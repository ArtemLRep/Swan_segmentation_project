<h1> Project description</h1>
            <p>
              This model based on dataset from <a href="https://hacks-ai.ru/hackathons.html?eventId=969064&caseEl=969235&tab=1" target="_blank">Hackathon</a>,
              organized by Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Russia. The task is to train Neural network to
              classify 3 types of rare swans: Whooper(Klikun in Russian transcription), Mute(Shipun) and Tundra swan(Malyi). The dataset consists of
              images, and masks. On competition I presented classification model, which is on <a href="https://github.com/ArtemLRep/Swan-Clf-project">ClfGitHub</a> page.
              But as an addition, I have trained my UNet model for image segmentation, that you can use here.
              Accuracy of Unet model on test data were 94.5% and intersection over union(IOU) were 70%.
